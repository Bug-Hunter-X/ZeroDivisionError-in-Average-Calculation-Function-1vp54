# Python Bug: ZeroDivisionError in Average Calculation

This repository demonstrates a common Python bug involving a `ZeroDivisionError` in a function designed to calculate the average of a list of numbers. The bug occurs when the input list is empty, leading to division by zero. The solution adds a check to handle this case gracefully.
